As unique identifiers, P-Codes overcome the challenges of linking datasets and confirming locations. We recommend using Gecodes and Names from OCHAs Common Operational Datasets: https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&amp;q=&amp;ext_page_size=25 6.1 A brief example of the problem: The geographic variables of the choices section of the xlsform typically look like this list_name name label cod_lga 1 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga 2 BAYO cod_lga 3 CHIBOK cod_lga 4 KALABAGE The geographic variables in corresponding GIS dataset look like this: Shape admin2Pcode admin2RefName Polygon NG008002 Askira/Uba Polygon NG008004 Bayo Polygon NG008006 Chibok Polygon NG008015 Kala/Balge Unfortunately, if we tried to merge the dataset and the GIS file by the name of the area, we would first have to fix the capitalization and punctuation of the names. To avoid unnecessary work, we recommend putting in the Pcode in the name column of the xlsform: list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga NG008004 BAYO cod_lga NG008006 CHIBOK cod_lga NG008015 KALABAGE With a common, simple variable to merge both datasets, mapping and data processing will be much easier! 6.2 Where to find Pcodes Geographic data can be found https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&amp;q=&amp;ext_page_size=25 and searching for the appropriate country. We recommend using the codes from the admin1Pcode and admin2Pcode columns in the name column of the xlsform. Using the admin1RefName and admin2RefName 6.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: xlsformwithgeocodesexample 6.4 2 caveats In some countries, the boundaries in the CODS might not correspond with the latest boundaries used by the country. In this case, special development of a GIS boundary file and codes will need to be developed. Inserting the relevant pcodes in the name column will probably require some vlookup . This might be relatively straightforward when only replacing codes at the admin1 and admin2 level, however things might get more complicated and difficult if cascading columns and the choice_filter option is used at the adm3, adm4 level.
