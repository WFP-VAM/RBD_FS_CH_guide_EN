Chapter 3 Gecodes explains how/why to put geo-codes into the data collection (xlsforms) to speed up mapping and data processing. Chapter 4 Household Hunger Scale paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS/R for calculating the Household Hunger Scale indicator. Chapter 5 reduced Coping Strategy Index paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS/R for calculating the reduced Coping Strategy Index indicator. Chapter 6 Food Consumption Score &amp; Household Dietary Diversity paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS/R for calculating the Food Consumption Score/Groups and Household Dietary Diversity Score indicators. Chapter 7 Livelihood Coping Strategies paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS/R for calculating the maximum coping strategy used for CARI light version and ENA version of the Livelihood Coping Strategies module. Chapter 8 Combined Questionnaire &amp; Syntaxes for all 5 indicators combines the questionnaires and syntaxes from chapter 4 - 7 for calculation of indicators. Chapter 9 Data Quality Monitoring Report provides instructions and syntax for an example data quality report which can be run using R and is compatible with standardized variable names Chapter 10 Calculating Matrice Intermediare provides instructions and a generic syntax to produce a matrice intermediare of direct food security indicators and geocodes from the processed data set in spss format Chapter 11 Visualizing CH Direct Food security Indicators provides instructions and a generic syntax for make maps and tables of the phasing of CH direct evdience indicators from the matrice intermediare or processed data set 1.0.2 About software While use of the software R &amp; Rstudio is necessary to produce the outputs in chapters 9, 10 and 11, users do not need to disrupt their normal data processing steps in SPSS. Syntax for calculating indicators in SPSS is provided in chapters 4 - 8 and countries. The R syntax used for the data quality monitoring report is compatible with the raw data that is downloaded from data collection servers (Kobo/MoDA etc.) and the R syntax used to produce the matrice intermediare is compatible with the processed data in spss format. 1.0.3 About the example datasets For this guide, two semi-fictitious data sets were created by randomly selecting and de-identifying surveys. The results are safe data sets that serve as a working examples for the syntaxes and processes illustrated in this guide: exampledataEnglish_raw - is what a raw data set should look like when downloaded from a ODK server in spss format. exampledataEnglish_processed - is what a processed data typically looks like (i.e. with calculated variables, weights, and other data processing).

Download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. 2.2 Installing packages After you install R &amp; Rstuidio , you will also need to install some R packages. The above video, covers the topic but re-stated, to do what we need to do in this guide well need to install and load certain packages. To install a package (tidyverse is an example, but its a good example because its a big pacakage that we will use a lot): install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) To load a package (tidyverse example), you can type the syntax below. library(tidyverse) 2.3 Using Rmarkdown Well use R Markdown to generate the reports in Chapter 9 and 11. The video below gives a nice introduction and overview of R markdown. "],["gecodes.html", "Chapter 3 Gecodes 3.1 A simple example of the problem: 3.2 Where to find Pcodes and more details 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: 3.4 2 caveats", " Chapter 3 Gecodes Names of geographic areas often create some clean up work in data processing as its not common for there to be issues and confusion over spelling, transliterations as well as alternative and duplicate names of areas. Using standardized geographic codes rather than geographic names helps overcome the challenges of processing geographic information. To this end, we recommend using Gecodes and Names from OCHAs Common Operational Datasets (CODs): https://data.humdata.org/dataset/west-and-central-africa-administrative-boundaries-levels 3.1 A simple example of the problem: The geographic variables of the choices section of the xlsform typically look like this. The name values are usually sequentially assigned. list_name name label cod_lga 1 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga 2 BAYO cod_lga 3 CHIBOK cod_lga 4 KALABAGE The geographic variables in corresponding GIS data set look like this: Shape admin2Pcode admin2RefName Polygon NG008002 Askira/Uba Polygon NG008004 Bayo Polygon NG008006 Chibok Polygon NG008015 Kala/Balge Unfortunately, if we tried to merge the data set and the GIS file by the name of the area (this seems to be the variable to join on), we would first have to fix the capitalization and punctuation of the names. To avoid unnecessary work, we recommend putting in the Pcode in the name column of the xlsform. list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga NG008004 BAYO cod_lga NG008006 CHIBOK cod_lga NG008015 KALABAGE Even better would be to use standardized name and label. list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 Askira/Uba cod_lga NG008004 Bayo cod_lga NG008006 Chibok cod_lga NG008015 Kala/Balge With a common, simple variable to merge both datasets, mapping and data processing should be faster and easier. 3.2 Where to find Pcodes and more details Geographic data for West and Central Africa can be found at https://data.humdata.org/dataset/west-and-central-africa-administrative-boundaries-levels or users can search for the appropriate country in https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod We recommend using the codes from the admin1Pcode and admin2Pcode columns in the name column of the xlsform. Using the admin1RefName and admin2RefName is also recommended in the label column of the xlsform 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: Here is an example dataset with names and labels matching the Common Operation Datasets. xlsformwithgeocodesexample 3.4 2 caveats In some countries, the boundaries in the CODs might not correspond with the latest boundaries used by the country. In this case, special development of a GIS boundary file and codes will need to be developed. Inserting the relevant pcodes in the name column will probably require some excel vlookup work. This might be relatively straightforward when only replacing codes at the admin1 and admin2 level, however things might get more complicated and difficult if cascading columns and the choice_filter option is used at the adm3, adm4 level.
