The example report below has been generalized to visualize survey progress by geographic areas and calculated results of key CH indicators by geographic areas and by enumerators using the raw data set downloaded from the Kobo/Ona/MoDa/ODK server. 8.1 Overview of the steps Download a .sav (spss) version of the dataset from Kobo/Ona/MoDa/ODK Create a folder on your machine (C: is recommended but not required) with the name of the survey (i.e. NGA_022021_EFSA) and create a sub-folder 1_RawData - save your SPSS dataset in the 1_RawData folder. Save the example_dqmonitoring_EN in the main survey folder Open up example_dqmonitoring_EN and verify the code (below) refers to the correct name of file and folder location. #set working directory setwd(&quot;C:/exampledataquality&quot;) #import dataset and call it &quot;dataset&quot; dataset &lt;- read_sav(&quot;1_RawData/exampledataEnglish_raw.sav&quot;) Also, if the variable name of the Enumerators is not EnumName, insert the following code #standardized enumerator name variable dataset &lt;- dataset %&gt;% rename(EnumName = OLDNAMEOFENUMERATORVARIABLE) before this code: #convert enumerator name back to code - because for data security reasons you dont want to publish the name of the operator dataset$EnumName &lt;- to_character(dataset$EnumName) Finally, click the Knit button and the report should generate (it might take a few minutes) (this video will be replaced with real one) 8.2 Data Quality Monitoring Tools 8.2.1 Example data set Here is the example data set: exampledataEnglish_raw 8.2.2 Example data quality report Here is the syntax to generate the example data quality report: example_dqmonitoring_EN 8.2.3 Outputs of Example data quality report Here is the example data quality report: example_dqmonitoring_EN 8.3 Troubleshooting &amp; Going Further This report has been designed to work with standardized variable names and indicators illustrated earlier in this guide. Experienced R users are free to modify the report to meet their specific needs. For any difficulties - contact rbd.vam@wfp.org "]]
