Briefly summarized, this guide introduces questionnaires, electronic data colection forms and syntax to collect and calculate standardized data. Standardized data improves comparability across and allows for faster and greater use of data tools and visualizations. A brief overview of the chapters in this guide: Chapter 2 Setting up R &amp; Rstudio - how to install R &amp; Rstudio software ; how to add require packages an overview on how to use Rmarkdown Chapter 1 Purpose &amp; How to use this Guide - where you are now, reading through could help you find the right place to go Chapter 2 Setting up R &amp; Rstudio - how to install R &amp; Rstudio software ; how to add require packages an overview on how to use Rmarkdown Chapter 3 Geocodes - explains how/why to put geo-codes into the data collection sheets to speed up mapping and data processing Chapter 4 Household Hunger Scale - paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS and R for calculating the Household Hunger Scale indicator Chapter 5 reduced Coping Strategy Index - paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS and R for calculating the reduced Coping Strategy Index indicator Chapter 6 Food Consumption Score &amp; Household Dietary Diversity Score - paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS and R for calculating the Food Consumption Score/Groups and Household Dietary Diversity Score. Chapter 7 Livelihood Coping Strategies - paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and syntax in SPSS and R for calculating maximum coping strategy used for CARI light version and ENA version of the Livelihood Coping Strategies module. Chapter 8 Combined Questionnaires and Syntaxes - puts the questionnaires and syntaxes from chapter 4 - 7 together Chapter 9 Data Quality Monitoring Report provides instruction and generic data quality report syntax which can be run using R and the survey raw data in spss format Chapter 10 Calculating Matrice Intermediare provides instruction and a generic syntax to produce a matrice intermediare of direct food security indicators and geocodes from the processed dataset in spss format Chapter 11 Visualizing CH Direct Food security Indicators using the matrice intermediare or processed dataset - make maps and tables of the phasing of areas by indicator About software - while use of the software R &amp; Rstudio is necessary to produce the outputs in chapters 7, 8 and 9, users do not need to disrupt their normal analysis processes - most commonly in SPSS. The R syntax used for the data quality management is compatible with the raw data that is downloaded from data collection servers. The R syntax used to produce the matrice intermediare is compatible with the processed data (calculated indicators and in spss format. About the example datasets - for this guide, two semi-fictitious datasets were created by randomly selecting and de-identifiying respondent answers from surveys from two countries. The results are safe datasets that serve as an example: exampledataEnglish_raw - is what a raw data looks like when downloaded from ODK server in spss format. exampledataEnglish_processed - mirrors what a processed data looks like - i.e. calculated indicators and a weight variable.

CRAN is composed of a set of mirror servers distributed around the world and is used to distribute R and R packages. Dont try and pick a mirror thats close to you: instead use the cloud mirror, https://cloud.r-project.org, which automatically figures it out for you. A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2-3 minor releases each year. Its a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions, which require you to reinstall all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html 2.1.2 RStudio RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. Download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When a new version is available, RStudio will let you know. Its a good idea to upgrade regularly so you can take advantage of the latest and greatest features. For this book, make sure you have at least RStudio 1.0.0. When you start RStudio, youll see two key regions in the interface: For now, all you need to know is that you type R code in the console pane, and press enter to run it. Youll learn more as we go along! copied from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html (gonna figure out how to cite it) 2.2 Installing packages Youll also need to install some R packages. An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. Using packages is key to the successful use of R. The majority of the packages that you will learn in this book are part of the so-called tidyverse. The packages in the tidyverse share a common philosophy of data and R programming, and are designed to work together naturally. You can install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) On your own computer, type that line of code in the console, and then press enter to run it. R will download the packages from CRAN and install them on to your computer. If you have problems installing, make sure that you are connected to the internet, and that https://cloud.r-project.org/ isnt blocked by your firewall or proxy. You will not be able to use the functions, objects, and help files in a package until you load it with library(). Once you have installed a package, you can load it with the library() function: library(tidyverse) "],["gecodes.html", "Chapter 3 Gecodes 3.1 A brief example of the problem: 3.2 Where to find Pcodes 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: 3.4 2 caveats", " Chapter 3 Gecodes Using names as identifiers can easily lead to confusion over spelling and transliterations as well as alternative and duplicate names. As unique identifiers, P-Codes overcome the challenges of linking datasets and confirming locations. We recommend using Gecodes and Names from OCHAs Common Operational Datasets: https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&amp;q=&amp;ext_page_size=25 3.1 A brief example of the problem: The geographic variables of the choices section of the xlsform typically look like this list_name name label cod_lga 1 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga 2 BAYO cod_lga 3 CHIBOK cod_lga 4 KALABAGE The geographic variables in corresponding GIS dataset look like this: Shape admin2Pcode admin2RefName Polygon NG008002 Askira/Uba Polygon NG008004 Bayo Polygon NG008006 Chibok Polygon NG008015 Kala/Balge Unfortunately, if we tried to merge the dataset and the GIS file by the name of the area, we would first have to fix the capitalization and punctuation of the names. To avoid unnecessary work, we recommend putting in the Pcode in the name column of the xlsform: list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga NG008004 BAYO cod_lga NG008006 CHIBOK cod_lga NG008015 KALABAGE With a common, simple variable to merge both datasets, mapping and data processing will be much easier! 3.2 Where to find Pcodes Geographic data can be found https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&amp;q=&amp;ext_page_size=25 and searching for the appropriate country. We recommend using the codes from the admin1Pcode and admin2Pcode columns in the name column of the xlsform. Using the admin1RefName and admin2RefName 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: xlsformwithgeocodesexample 3.4 2 caveats In some countries, the boundaries in the CODS might not correspond with the latest boundaries used by the country. In this case, special development of a GIS boundary file and codes will need to be developed. Inserting the relevant pcodes in the name column will probably require some vlookup . This might be relatively straightforward when only replacing codes at the admin1 and admin2 level, however things might get more complicated and difficult if cascading columns and the choice_filter option is used at the adm3, adm4 level.
