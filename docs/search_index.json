Chapter 3 Gecodes explains how/why to use geo-codes in data collection (xlsforms) to speed up mapping and data processing. Chapter 4 Household Hunger Scale paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and SPSS/R syntax for calculating the Household Hunger Scale indicator. Chapter 5 reduced Coping Strategy Index paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and SPSS/R syntax for calculating the reduced Coping Strategy Index indicator. Chapter 6 Food Consumption Score &amp; Household Dietary Diversity paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and SPSS/R syntax for calculating the Food Consumption Score/Groups and Household Dietary Diversity Score indicators. Chapter 7 Livelihood Coping Strategies paper and electronic versions of standardized questionnaire and SPSS/R syntax for calculating the maximum coping strategy used for CARI light version and ENA version of the Livelihood Coping Strategies module. Chapter 8 Combined Questionnaire &amp; Syntaxes for all 5 indicators combines the questionnaires and syntaxes from chapter 4 - 7. Chapter 9 Data Quality Monitoring Report provides instructions and R syntax for a data quality monitoring report, using raw survey data. Chapter 10 Calculating Matrice Intermediare provides instructions and a generic R syntax to produce from a processed spss file the direct food security indicators and geocodes which can be copied into the matrice intermediare. Chapter 11 Visualizing CH Direct Food security Indicators provides instructions and generic R syntax for visualizing maps and tables of the phasing of CH direct evidence indicators from the matrice intermediare or a processed data set. 1.0.2 About software While use of the software R &amp; Rstudio is necessary to produce the outputs in chapters 9, 10 and 11, users who arent ready to fully replace SPPS with R for their survey processes do not need to disrupt their normal data processing steps (cleaning, calculating, indicators, adding weights, etc) - this can remain in SPSS. Syntax for calculating indicators in SPSS is provided in chapters 4 - 8 . The R syntax used for the data quality monitoring report is compatible with the raw data that is downloaded from data collection servers (Kobo/MoDA etc.) and the R syntax used to produce the matrice intermediare is compatible with the processed data in spss format. 1.0.3 About the example datasets For this guide, two semi-fictitious data sets were created by randomly selecting and de-identifying several surveys. The results are safe data sets that serve as examples for the syntax and processes illustrated in this guide: exampledataEnglish_raw - is what a raw data set typically should look like when collecting with standardized modules and downloaded from a ODK server in spss format. exampledataEnglish_processed - is what a processed data typically should look like when applying standardized syntax to calculate indicators and adding survey weights. 1.0.4 About the questionnaires and variable names The standardized questionnaires were developed from official guidelines/references listed in the chapters and were adapted reflecting after consultation with several food security analysts. While many questions in this guide were taken verbatim from the official references, the wording of some question modules follow the opinion that instructing enumerators to repeat the content of a question such as recall period (i.e. in the last 7 days) and qualifier (because lack of food or lack of money to buy food) explicitly within the question text is better practice than having enumerators read introductory text (i.e. In the last 7 days, because of lack of food did you have to use the following strategies) and then read off a list of food items/strategies. The variable names in this guide were largely copied from a draft master codebook which is forthcoming. 1.0.5 About coding style Most of the code in this guide uses the tidyverse, but it might not be elegant or efficient. It gets the job done but future work will be to try to make it comply with the tidyverse style code: https://style.tidyverse.org/. For now, one key thing to note. Most of the time, the code refers to the label (i.e. Yes) rather than the value (i.e. 1). There are trade-offs with this approach. Using a label makes it easier to read what the code is trying to do and troubleshoot a problem. The disadvantage is it makes the code more long winded and it makes it more fussy because the labels (and sometimes they can be long) must exactly match the code. 1.0.6 One last about - About proposing fixes and suggestions Finally, this guide is just a start. If you spot an error, find something confusing, have a suggestion or a better way of doing something - dont be a stranger.

If R is the engine, Rstudio is the steering wheel. Download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. 2.2 Installing packages After you install R &amp; Rstuidio , you will also need to install some R packages. The above video covers the topic but re-stated, to do what we need to do in this guide well need to install and load certain packages. To install a package (tidyverse is an example, but its a good example because its a big packaage that we will use a lot): install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) To load a package (tidyverse example), you can type the syntax below. library(tidyverse) 2.3 Using Rmarkdown Well use R Markdown to generate the reports in Chapter 9 and 11. The video below gives a nice introduction and overview of R markdown. "],["gecodes.html", "Chapter 3 Gecodes 3.1 A simple example of the problem: 3.2 Where to find Pcodes and more details 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: 3.4 2 caveats", " Chapter 3 Gecodes Names of geographic areas, while simple enough to put in a data collection tool, often require some clean up work in data processing for the results to match GIS files. Its very common for there to be issues and confusion over spelling, transliterations,alternative and duplicate names of areas. Using standardized geographic codes rather than geographic names helps bound over some of these typical challenges of processing geographic information. To this end, this guide recommends using Geocodes and Names from OCHAs Common Operational Data sets (CODs): https://data.humdata.org/dataset/west-and-central-africa-administrative-boundaries-levels 3.1 A simple example of the problem: The geographic variables of the choices section of a xlsform typically look like this. The name values are usually sequentially assigned. list_name name label cod_lga 1 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga 2 BAYO cod_lga 3 CHIBOK cod_lga 4 KALABAGE The geographic variables in a corresponding GIS data set look like this: Shape admin2Pcode admin2RefName Polygon NG008002 Askira/Uba Polygon NG008004 Bayo Polygon NG008006 Chibok Polygon NG008015 Kala/Balge Unfortunately, if we tried to merge the data set and the GIS file by the name of the area (this seems to be the variable to join on), we would first have to fix the capitalization and punctuation of the names. To avoid unnecessary work, we recommend putting in the Pcode in the name column of the xlsform. list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga NG008004 BAYO cod_lga NG008006 CHIBOK cod_lga NG008015 KALABAGE Even better, also use standardized names and labels. list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 Askira/Uba cod_lga NG008004 Bayo cod_lga NG008006 Chibok cod_lga NG008015 Kala/Balge With a common, simple variable to merge both data sets, mapping and data processing can become faster and easier. 3.2 Where to find Pcodes and more details Geographic data for West and Central Africa can be found at https://data.humdata.org/dataset/west-and-central-africa-administrative-boundaries-levels or users can search for the appropriate country information in https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod We recommend using the codes from the admin1Pcode and admin2Pcode columns in the name column of the xlsform. Using the admin1RefName and admin2RefName is also recommended in the label column of the xlsform. 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: Here is an example data set with names and labels matching the Common Operation Datasets. xlsformwithgeocodesexample 3.4 2 caveats In a few countries, the boundaries in the CODs might not correspond with the boundaries used by the country. In this case, special development of a GIS boundary file and codes will need to be developed. Inserting the relevant pcodes in the name column to an existing xlsform will probably require some excel vlookup work. This might be relatively straightforward when only replacing codes at the admin1 and admin2 level, however things might get more complicated if cascading columns and the choice_filter option is used at the adm3, adm4 level.
