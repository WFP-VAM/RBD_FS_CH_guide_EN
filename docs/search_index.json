CRAN is composed of a set of mirror servers distributed around the world and is used to distribute R and R packages. Dont try and pick a mirror thats close to you: instead use the cloud mirror, https://cloud.r-project.org, which automatically figures it out for you. A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2-3 minor releases each year. Its a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions, which require you to reinstall all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse. https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html 2.1.2 RStudio RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming. Download and install it from http://www.rstudio.com/download. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year. When a new version is available, RStudio will let you know. Its a good idea to upgrade regularly so you can take advantage of the latest and greatest features. For this book, make sure you have at least RStudio 1.0.0. When you start RStudio, youll see two key regions in the interface: For now, all you need to know is that you type R code in the console pane, and press enter to run it. Youll learn more as we go along! copied from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html (gonna figure out how to cite it) 2.2 Installing packages Youll also need to install some R packages. An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. Using packages is key to the successful use of R. The majority of the packages that you will learn in this book are part of the so-called tidyverse. The packages in the tidyverse share a common philosophy of data and R programming, and are designed to work together naturally. You can install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code: install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) On your own computer, type that line of code in the console, and then press enter to run it. R will download the packages from CRAN and install them on to your computer. If you have problems installing, make sure that you are connected to the internet, and that https://cloud.r-project.org/ isnt blocked by your firewall or proxy. You will not be able to use the functions, objects, and help files in a package until you load it with library(). Once you have installed a package, you can load it with the library() function: library(tidyverse) "],["gecodes.html", "Chapter 3 Gecodes 3.1 A brief example of the problem: 3.2 Where to find Pcodes 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: 3.4 2 caveats", " Chapter 3 Gecodes Using names as identifiers can easily lead to confusion over spelling and transliterations as well as alternative and duplicate names. As unique identifiers, P-Codes overcome the challenges of linking datasets and confirming locations. We recommend using Gecodes and Names from OCHAs Common Operational Datasets: https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&amp;q=&amp;ext_page_size=25 3.1 A brief example of the problem: The geographic variables of the choices section of the xlsform typically look like this list_name name label cod_lga 1 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga 2 BAYO cod_lga 3 CHIBOK cod_lga 4 KALABAGE The geographic variables in corresponding GIS dataset look like this: Shape admin2Pcode admin2RefName Polygon NG008002 Askira/Uba Polygon NG008004 Bayo Polygon NG008006 Chibok Polygon NG008015 Kala/Balge Unfortunately, if we tried to merge the dataset and the GIS file by the name of the area, we would first have to fix the capitalization and punctuation of the names. To avoid unnecessary work, we recommend putting in the Pcode in the name column of the xlsform: list_name name label cod_lga NG008002 ASKIRA/UBA cod_lga NG008004 BAYO cod_lga NG008006 CHIBOK cod_lga NG008015 KALABAGE With a common, simple variable to merge both datasets, mapping and data processing will be much easier! 3.2 Where to find Pcodes Geographic data can be found https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&amp;q=&amp;ext_page_size=25 and searching for the appropriate country. We recommend using the codes from the admin1Pcode and admin2Pcode columns in the name column of the xlsform. Using the admin1RefName and admin2RefName 3.3 Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria: xlsformwithgeocodesexample 3.4 2 caveats In some countries, the boundaries in the CODS might not correspond with the latest boundaries used by the country. In this case, special development of a GIS boundary file and codes will need to be developed. Inserting the relevant pcodes in the name column will probably require some vlookup . This might be relatively straightforward when only replacing codes at the admin1 and admin2 level, however things might get more complicated and difficult if cascading columns and the choice_filter option is used at the adm3, adm4 level.
