# Data Quality Monitoring Report

If survey teams are collecting data with Kobo/Ona/MoDa/ODK and regularly sending their submissions to a server, then we can quickly generate a data quality report with R to regularly track survey results and detect problems that may arise in the field with data collection.

The example report below has been generalized to visualize survey progress by geographic areas and calculated results of key CH indicators by geographic areas and by enumerators.

## Data Quality Monitoring Tools

### Example data set

Here is the example data set:
[exampledataEng](https://github.com/WFP-VAM/RBD_FS_CH_guide_EN/blob/master/example_datasets/exampledataEng.sav) 

### Example data quality report

Here is the syntax to generate the example data quality report:
[example_dqmonitoring_EN](https://github.com/WFP-VAM/RBD_FS_CH_guide_EN/blob/master/syntax/example_dqmonitoring_EN.sav) 


### Outputs of Example data quality report

Here is the example data quality report:

## Troubleshooting & Going Further

This report has been designed to work with standardized variable names and indicators illustrated earlier in this guide. Experienced R users are free to modify the report to meet their specific needs.
