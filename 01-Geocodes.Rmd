# Gecodes

Using names as identifiers can easily lead to confusion over spelling and transliterations as well as alternative and duplicate names.

As unique identifiers, P-Codes overcome the challenges of linking datasets and confirming locations.

We recommend using Gecodes and Names from OCHA's Common Operational Datasets: 
https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&q=&ext_page_size=25

## A brief example of the problem:

The geographic variables of the *choices* section of the  xlsform typically look like this

list_name | name | label
---- | --- |---- 
cod_lga | 1 | ASKIRA/UBA
cod_lga | 2 | BAYO
cod_lga | 3 | CHIBOK
cod_lga | 4 | KALABAGE

The geographic variables in corresponding GIS dataset look like this:

Shape | admin2Pcode | admin2RefName
---- | --- |---- 
Polygon |NG008002 | Askira/Uba
Polygon |NG008004 | Bayo
Polygon |NG008006 | Chibok
Polygon |NG008015 | Kala/Balge

Unfortunately, if we tried to merge the dataset and the GIS file by the name of the area, we would first have to fix the capitalization and punctuation of the names.

To avoid unnecessary work, we recommend putting in the *Pcode* in the name column of the xlsform:

list_name | name | label
---- | --- |---- 
cod_lga | NG008002 | ASKIRA/UBA
cod_lga | NG008004 | BAYO
cod_lga | NG008006 | CHIBOK
cod_lga | NG008015 | KALABAGE

With a common, simple variable to merge both datasets, mapping and data processing will be much easier!

## Where to find Pcodes

Geographic data can be found https://data.humdata.org/dashboards/cod?ext_geodata=1&q=&ext_page_size=25 and searching for the appropriate country.

We recommend using the codes from the *admin1Pcode* and *admin2Pcode* columns in the *name* column of the xlsform.  Using the *admin1RefName* and *admin2RefName*

## Example data set of the data collection sheet for Nigeria:

## 2 caveats

1. In some countries, the boundaries in the CODS might not correspond with the latest boundaries used by the country.  In this case, special development of a GIS boundary file and codes will need to be developed.

2. Inserting the relevant pcodes in the *name* column will probably require some *vlookup* .  This might be relatively straightforward when only replacing codes at the admin1 and admin2 level, however things might get more complicated and difficult if cascading columns and the *choice_filter* option is used at the adm3, adm4 level.
